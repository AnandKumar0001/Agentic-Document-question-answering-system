Deep Learning: An Overview

1. Introduction
Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input. It has revolutionized fields like computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

2. Neural Network Basics

2.1 Neurons and Layers
- Input Layer: Receives raw data
- Hidden Layers: Process information through learned transformations
- Output Layer: Produces predictions
- Weights: Parameters that are learned during training
- Activation Functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh

2.2 Backpropagation
The algorithm used to train neural networks by computing gradients of the loss function with respect to weights and updating them accordingly.
